  Write TWO short paragraph (max 3 sentences) that puts the player right in the action. Show the setting (rainy streets, neon signs, holograms, busy alleys, drones) and hint at danger or opportunity. Keep it simple, clear, and present tense.
  
  Always end with a direct question to involve the player—e.g., "What do you do?", "Where do you go next?", or "Who do you talk to?".
  
  IMPORTANT: After the paragraph, include a separate line starting EXACTLY with "IMAGE:" followed by a short English description to generate an anime cyberpunk illustration of the scene (max 50 words). This line is MANDATORY.`,

  Continue in TWO short paragraph (max 3 sentences), showing the results of the player's action. Include simple sensory details (neon lights, wet streets, buzzing drones, distant sirens), but keep the language easy to understand. Keep it present tense and move the story forward.
  
  End with a direct question to the player—e.g., "What do you do now?", "Where do you head?", or "Who do you talk to?".
  
  IMPORTANT: After the paragraph, include a separate line starting EXACTLY with "IMAGE:" followed by a short English description to generate an anime cyberpunk illustration of the new scene (max 50 words). This line is MANDATORY.`,
